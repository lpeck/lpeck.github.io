		<div class="bio"><p>Lisa was first introduced to coding while pursuing a statistics degree at Michigan State University. After breezing through MatLab and SAS, she enrolled in a Python course offered in the engineering program, which led to tears almost daily. 
		<br><br>
		She passed the course and thought to herself "I'm never doing this again."
		<br><br>
		After finishing her degree and entering the workforce, Lisa bounced around from the private sector to government work, and back again. Her role ranged from data modeling to IT support, and even bartending. Each job leaves her wondering "What's next?"
		<br><br>10 years later Lisa now works as a project manager for Conga, a tech company that specializes in Salesforce apps. She's developed a new understanding of her own potential and where a more solid coding background can take her. She decided to enroll in University of Denver's Coding Bootcamp program to add web development to her growing list of skills.</p>
